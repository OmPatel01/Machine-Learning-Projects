I have built a user interface for this project using Streamlit. [Click here](https://mallcustomersegmentation.streamlit.app/) to explore the web app made using Streamlit.

## K-Means Clustering

In this project, K-Means clustering is utilized to segment mall customers based on their annual income and spending score. K-Means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that partitions data into clusters, with each cluster represented by its centroid. It iteratively assigns data points to the nearest centroid and updates the centroids until convergence.

## Importance of Customer Segmentation

Customer segmentation is crucial for businesses to understand the diverse needs and preferences of their customer base. By categorizing customers into distinct groups based on common characteristics, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies, product offerings, and customer experiences to better meet the needs of each segment. This enhances customer satisfaction, improves customer retention, and drives profitability.

## Clusters Formed

In this project, five clusters are formed using K-Means clustering:

- **Cluster 0: Mid Income, Mid Spending**
  - Description: Customers with moderate income and moderate spending habits.
  - Characteristics: They are neither high spenders nor low spenders.

- **Cluster 1: High Income, Low Spending**
  - Description: Customers with high income but conservative spending behavior.
  - Characteristics: They prioritize savings or investments over unnecessary spending.

- **Cluster 2: Low Income, Low Spending**
  - Description: Customers with low income and minimal spending.
  - Characteristics: They prioritize essential purchases and have limited capacity for additional spending.

- **Cluster 3: Low Income, High Spending**
  - Description: Customers with low income but high spending habits.
  - Characteristics: They engage in impulse buying or prioritize lifestyle purchases despite financial constraints.

- **Cluster 4: High Income, High Spending**
  - Description: Customers with high income and excessive spending habits.
  - Characteristics: They have significant purchasing power and indulge in luxury goods or premium experiences.

## Conclusion

Customer segmentation through K-Means clustering reveals distinct shopping personalities within the customer base. By understanding the characteristics and preferences of each segment, businesses can develop targeted marketing campaigns, personalized offerings, and tailored experiences to effectively engage and retain customers, ultimately driving business growth and success.

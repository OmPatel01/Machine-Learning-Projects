# Machine Learning Projects 📚🤖

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Projects** repository! This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects that showcase my skills in **Regression**, **Classification**, and **Clustering** techniques. Each folder houses projects with detailed explanations, code, and results. The goal is to provide hands-on examples of applying machine learning algorithms to real-world problems.

## 📂 Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

- **`Regression/`**: Projects focused on regression tasks such as predicting continuous variables.
- **`Classification/`**: Projects that involve classification problems, where the goal is to assign labels to data points.
- **`Clustering/`**: Projects that explore unsupervised learning techniques for grouping similar data.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used

Throughout these projects, I have leveraged the following tools and technologies:

- **Languages**:  
  - Python 

- **Libraries & Frameworks**:  
  - **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn , TensorFlow 
  - **Data Manipulation & Analysis**: Pandas , NumPy 
  - **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib , Seaborn 

- **Tools**:  
  - Jupyter Notebooks 📓
  - Google Colab ☁️
  - VS Code 💻

## 🔍 Project Highlights

Here’s an overview of the projects within each folder:

### 📉 **Regression Projects**
1. **Predicting House Prices**: Using linear regression and decision trees to predict house prices based on features like location, size, and amenities.
  
### 🏷️ **Classification Projects**
1. **Credit Risk Prediction**: Predicting whether a borrower will default on a loan based on historical data using classification algorithms like Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
2. **Spam Email Detection**: Classifying emails as spam or not spam using techniques like Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

### 📊 **Clustering Projects**
1. **Customer Segmentation**: Applying K-Means clustering to segment customers based on purchase behavior and demographics.

## 🚀 Key Skills & Concepts

By working on these projects, I’ve gained hands-on experience with the following:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, scaling, encoding categorical variables, and feature selection.
- **Model Evaluation**: Using metrics like RMSE, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC to evaluate model performance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Implementing GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model parameters.
- **Cross-Validation**: Ensuring model robustness and avoiding overfitting through cross-validation techniques.

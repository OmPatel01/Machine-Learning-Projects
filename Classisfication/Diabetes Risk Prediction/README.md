# ü©∫ Diabetes Risk Prediction

This project aims to predict the risk of diabetes using a machine learning model trained on a dataset with various health-related features. The project explores the use of Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers to determine the likelihood of diabetes based on the given inputs.

## üìä Dataset Features

The dataset consists of the following features:

1. **Age**: Age of the individual (numeric).
2. **Gender**: Gender of the individual (binary: Male/Female).
3. **Polyuria**: Frequent urination (binary: Yes/No).
4. **Polydipsia**: Excessive thirst (binary: Yes/No).
5. **Sudden weight loss**: Sudden weight loss (binary: Yes/No).
6. **Weakness**: Generalized weakness (binary: Yes/No).
7. **Polyphagia**: Excessive hunger (binary: Yes/No).
8. **Genital thrush**: Fungal infection around the genital area (binary: Yes/No).
9. **Visual blurring**: Blurred vision (binary: Yes/No).
10. **Itching**: Generalized itching (binary: Yes/No).
11. **Irritability**: Increased irritability (binary: Yes/No).
12. **Delayed healing**: Delay in healing wounds (binary: Yes/No).
13. **Partial paresis**: Partial muscle weakness (binary: Yes/No).
14. **Muscle stiffness**: Stiffness in muscles (binary: Yes/No).
15. **Alopecia**: Hair loss (binary: Yes/No).
16. **Obesity**: Obesity status (binary: Yes/No).
17. **Class**: The target variable indicating the presence of diabetes (binary: Positive/Negative).

## üõ†Ô∏è Model Training

### Decision Tree

The first model trained was a Decision Tree classifier. However, the model exhibited signs of overfitting, achieving perfect accuracy on the training set but performing less effectively on the test set.

### Random Forest

Next, a Random Forest classifier was trained to mitigate the overfitting observed with the Decision Tree. Although the Random Forest model performed better, it still showed signs of overfitting.

### Cross-Validation

To further improve the model's generalization, a 10-fold cross-validation was performed. This technique helped in assessing the model's performance across different subsets of the data, providing a more reliable estimate of its accuracy.

### üìà Model Evaluation

The ROC AUC curve was used to evaluate the performance of both models. The Random Forest classifier demonstrated better performance compared to the Decision Tree, as indicated by a higher AUC score.

## üìå Conclusion

The Random Forest model, after applying cross-validation, outperformed the Decision Tree model in predicting diabetes risk. Despite initial signs of overfitting, the use of cross-validation helped in achieving a more robust model.
